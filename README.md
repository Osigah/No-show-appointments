# Project---Investigate-a-Dataset-No-show-appointments

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment
I used this data to analyse and discover trends in the data such as if the patients showed up or not, types of diseases more likely to make a patient show up and much more.
